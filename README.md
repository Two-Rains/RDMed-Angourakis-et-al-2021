**Abstract**  
The urban phase of the Indus Civilisation (c. 2600/2500-1900 BC) presents a compelling case of contrasting trajectories of different components of a socio-ecological system, where the decline of urban lifeways coexists with the resilience of rural contexts. Seemly robust cities, whose occupation endured centuries, appear to have been ultimately unsustainable when facing a prolonged period of aridification. Villages, however, occupied a central place in the Indus settlement system before, during, and after the urban period, suggesting that rural lifeways remained flexible and capable of adaptive transformation. Indus archaeology offers a myriad of lines of evidence on this subject, which is unfortunately seldom unified in a single model.
We present an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach to illuminate the trajectory of the Indus Civilisation, the Indus Village model. This model aims to simulate rural settlements through the interaction of a population of farming households with its local environment. It consists of a set of modular components (submodels) designed to be sufficiently explicit, but still generic, representations of weather and land systems, food economy, demography and settlement at a local-to-regional scale. We expect to use it as a ‘virtual laboratory’ to explore different scenarios of adaptation to environmental conditions, specifically assessing the level of resilience of different cropping strategies (e.g., mono- versus multi-cropping). The core hypothesis to test is that strategies emphasising diversity strengthen resilience in front of climate change, but generally decrease the surplus needed for sustaining the urban (i.e., non-food-producer) population.
The Indus Village model represents an ongoing group effort to integrate contextual knowledge, datasets, assumptions, and narratives into a single coherent framework. Although ambitious in its scope and complexity, the model is intended to be rigorous, controllable, and intelligible at all stages of development. Additionally, by keeping its design modular and public, we aim to guarantee its usefulness to future models and generations of modellers. This work is part of TwoRains (2015-2020, ERC H2020-grant number 648609), a multi-disciplinary project focused on understanding human adaptations to variable rainfall systems and climate change in Indus Civilisation sites in Haryana, NW India. All files related to the Indus Village model and its submodels are stored under version control in a public repository (https://github.com/Andros-Spica/indus-village-model).
